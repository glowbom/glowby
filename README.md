### Questions Pre-set

One of the powerful features of Glowby Basic is the ability to pre-set questions and answers for your AI assistant. Using [Glowbom.com](https://www.glowbom.com), you can create a knowledge base of questions and answers that your AI assistant can use to provide instant responses. 
![Glowby Basic Demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2455891/232735288-abb5f9d8-3d51-4170-a6dd-a967e7d8ae30.gif)

If the answer to a question is not found locally, the app will make a server request to retrieve the relevant information, ensuring that users receive accurate and helpful responses.

### Autonomous Mode (Experimental)
