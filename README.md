# Glowby Basic - Voice-Based AI Agent Builder

Glowby Basic is an open source application that lets you build your own basic but powerful voiced-based AI agent that can help you do various tasts.

Glowby is a humorous AI assistant that helps users build apps on [Glowbom.com](https://www.glowbom.com). This project helps you build your own versions of Glowby. We're currently open-sourcing the Flutter-based chat component, with more platforms coming soon.
