## How it works...

Glowby Genius is a draw-to-code software creation tool. If you want to quickly and easily develop an app, just attach your designs, simply draw whatever you want to build, and export your code to JavaScript and Tailwind CSS, SwiftUI, Kotlin, or Flutter.

To run SwiftUI, Kotlin, or Flutter projects you need to setup local IDE (Xcode, Android Studio, or Visual Studio Code) and download a custom project from [**Glowbom**](https://glowbom.com/). Next, you need to open the project on your machine and copy the code generated by Glowby into the AiExtension file. The app also supports the offline mode that runs [OpenHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B](https://huggingface.co/teknium/OpenHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B) locally on Vision Pro to work without internet.
