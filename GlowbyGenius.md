## Running SwiftUI, Flutter, or Kotlin Jetpack Compose apps

To run SwiftUI, Kotlin, or Flutter projects you need to setup local IDE (Xcode, Android Studio, or Visual Studio Code) and download a custom project from [*Glowbom*](glowbom.com). Next, you need to open the project on your machine and copy the code generated by Glowby into the AiExtension file.
